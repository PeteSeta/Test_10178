This repository contains tools that i'm experimenting on. Feel free to explore but nothing is complete.

#### The folder names are self explanitory, but here is a list:

* RestrectionsHasher = Cracking the restrections passcode on a iOS device, instructions provided in html page.
* MasterCombo = Cracking a master combination lock in real life, only using a computer to assist and calculate numbers.
* Arduino Code from June 2018 = Random arduino code I wrote per the arduino starter kit guide book. Copy as you wish.
